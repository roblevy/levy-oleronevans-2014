\begin{abstract}
A global model is presented that can be used as the basis for assessing the impacts of future changes in trade, migration, security and development aid.
The model is based on input-output models for 40 countries, linked with trade data at the sector level.
This is made possible by the World Input-Output Database, a collection of input-output tables for 40 countries across 15 years, and by databases of commodities and services trade from the UN.
The model is constructed using a minimal number of assumptions, and is based as far as possible on empirical observation.
Some initial analysis of the model and its properties is also presented

\section{Introduction}
The objective of this paper is to present a global economic model that can be used as the basis for assessing the impacts of future changes in trade, migration, security and development aid.
The model presented here represents a first `proof of concept' step towards this ambitious goal.
The economies of individual countries are represented as 35-sector input-output models, each of which is linked through trade flows representing imports and exports.
This has recently been made feasible by the publication of the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) \parencite{timmer_world_2012}, a collection of national input-output tables (NIOTs) for 40 countries across 15 years, from 1995 to 2009.
The NIOTs are linked through data from the UN covering trade in both goods\footnote{comtrade.un.org/db} and services\footnote{unstats.un.org/unsd/servicetrade/}.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: 
Section \ref{sec:litreview} gives an overview of existing work in this area;
Section \ref{sec:system} gives a description of the present system and outlines how data is used to calibrate the parameters of the model;
The algorithm used to calculate the output of the model is described in section \ref{sec:algorithm} and some preliminary results are given in section \ref{sec:analysis}.
Some concluding comments are added in section \ref{sec:conclusions}.

\section{Existing Global Economic Models} \label{sec:litreview}
In the mid-1970s, the creator of input-output economics, Wassily Leontief, had just won the Nobel prize for Economics and took the prestige that this bestowed on him as an opportunity to announce a very ambitious project to model the global economy:

\begin{quotation}
Major efforts are underway to construct a data base for a systematic input-output study not of a single national economy but of the world economy viewed as a system composed of many interrelated parts [...]
Preliminary plans provide for a description of the world economy in terms of twenty-eight groups of countries, with about forty-five productive sectors for each group. \attrib{\cite{leontief_structure_1974}}
\end{quotation}

Some twenty years later, Faye Duchin, a former research assistant of Leontief, described how Leontief's efforts in this area have largely been ignored by economists, describing his departures from the standard, neoclassical modelling in terms of price elasticity and elasticity of substitution as being ``too great to ignore'' \parencite{duchin_international_2004}. 
See section \ref{sec:iots} for more on this subject.

In the years since Leontief published his global model, input-output analysis has been largely restricted to regional studies, of which \textcite{akita_interregional_1993}, \textcite{khan_sectoral_1999} and \textcite{luo_power--pull_2013} are examples; and studies related to energy and the environment, such as  \textcite{leontief_environmental_1970}, \textcite{joshi_product_1999}, \textcite{bergh_handbook_2002} and \textcite{hendrickson_environmental_2006}.

However, much more recently, attention has returned to input-output modelling in a global context more generally. \textcite{tukker_global_2013} describe how several multi-regional input-output (MRIO) models have been developed in the very recent literature.
These are, along with the WIOD which is used in the present model, EORA \parencite{lenzen_building_2013}, EXIOPOL \parencite{tukker_exiopol_2013} and the slightly more mature, but proprietorial GTAP \parencite{walmsley_introduction_2012}.

Each of these existing models of the global economy extend the idea of the national input-output table to an international setting: where the magnitude of every bilateral sector--sector flow is recorded for a given country in an NIOT, these projects record the magnitude of every country/sector--country/sector flow.
Thus, for example, the extent to which British agriculture purchases from Belgian manufacturing is recorded in dollar amounts.
This results in a very large matrix which, by inverting in the normal input-output way, can be used to predict the impact of a particular exogenous change in demand.
The authors believe that this is taking the simplicity and elegance of input-output analysis a little far. The idea that each sector buys in fixed proportion from each other sector in each other country turns the above-mentioned ignoring of price- and substitution-elasticities from a convenient simplification in the case of the NIOT to an out-and-out denial of the concept of economic dynamics.

The present model provides a framework in which the power of input-output analysis at the national level can be combined with a more subtle understanding of the dynamics of international trade.
It also provides modellers with a broader set of parameters than the standard technical coefficients of WIOTs which will facilitate the combination of the present model with other models of human systems, such as migration, international security and development aid.

\section{The System Description} \label{sec:system}
The model presented here has $c$ countries, the economies of which are divided into $s$ productive sectors.
Although each sector produces many distinct goods, for the sake of simplicity, these goods are considered to be perfect substitutes, allowing the terms `sector' and `product' to be used interchangeably throughout this paper.
All goods flows are given by value, measured in millions of current price US\$.
For the remainder of this paper the terms `quantity' and `value' will therefore be used interchangeably.
Goods produced domestically are labelled with a dagger superscript ($\dagger$) and imported goods with an asterisk superscript.
Table \ref{tbl:cvars} shows the quantities, taken from data published by the WIOD, which characterise a country's economy for a particular year.
Note that for clarity, no time subscript is added. In future time-series analyses such a subscript would have to be added.

\subsection{Input-Output Tables} \label{sec:iots}
Input-output is, at its heart, an accounting methodology.
The products produced by and imported into a given country in a given year must be either: sold as inputs to other sectors (`intermediate supply'); supplied to the `final demand' of consumers and the government; invested; or exported.
The total amount imported and produced must equal the amount used, consumed, invested and exported for each sector.

By simple summation, total production of sector $s$ in country $i$ can be defined as the sum of all intermediate supply, plus supply to final demand, investment and export:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:x}
x_s^{(i)}=\sum\limits_{t}z_{s,t}^{\dagger(i)} + f_s^{\dagger(i)} + n_s^{\dagger(i)} + e_s^{(i)}
\end{equation}
where $z_{s,t}^{\dagger(i)}$ is the intermediate supply from domestic sector $s$ to sector $t$ in country $i$, $f_s^{\dagger(i)}$ is final demand for domestic sector $s$, $n_s^{\dagger(i)}$ is investment and $e_s^{(i)}$ are exports.
The total import of sector $s$ in country $i$ is the sum of all intermediate supply by imported goods, plus demand for and investment of imported goods. 
It should be noted that, in this iteration of the model, imported goods may not be directly exported, though they may naturally supply intermediate demand of sectors whose output is itself exported.
In other words, \textit{re-exports} are set to zero:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:m}
m_s^{(i)}=\sum\limits_{t}z_{s,t}^{*(i)} + f_s^* + n_s^*
\end{equation}

For a particular sector, we use the phrase `total demand '  to refer to the sum of final demand, investments and exports, including domestically produced and imported goods.

An input-output table, $\boldsymbol{T}^{(i)}$, as described by \textcite{miller_input-output_1985}, is a particular arrangement of these quantities, which provides a clear and compact summary of the structure of a national economy.
Neglecting the $(i)$ superscript for clarity, the input-output table (IOT) is defined as follows:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:T}
\begin{array}{rc}
\begin{array}{cc} & \mbox{Sector} \end{array} 
& 
\begin{array}{cccc} \hspace*{4mm}1 & \mathellipsis & s & \hspace*{2mm} \mbox{F.D. Inv Exp Tot} \end{array} \vspace*{2mm} \\
\begin{array}{r}
\begin{array}{rc}
\mbox{Domestic} & \left\{ \begin{array}{c}
1 \\
\vdots \\
s
\end{array} \right. \\
\mbox{Imports} & \left\{ \begin{array}{c}
1 \\
\vdots \\
s \\
\end{array} \right.
\end{array} \vspace*{2mm} \\
%\begin{array}{cc} \hspace*{17mm} & \mbox{Value Added} \end{array}
\end{array} &
\left( \begin{array}{ccccccc}
z^{\dag}_{1,1} & \mathellipsis & z^{\dag}_{1,s} & f^\dag_{1} & n^\dag_{1} & e_{1} & x_1 \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
z^{\dag}_{s,1} & \mathellipsis & z^{\dag}_{s,s} & f^\dag_{s} & n^\dag_{s} & e_{s} & x_{s} \\
z^*_{1,1} & \mathellipsis & z^*_{1,s} & f^*_{1} & n^*_{1} & 0 & i_1 \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
z^*_{s,1} & \mathellipsis & z^*_{s,s} & f^*_{s} & n^*_{s} & 0 & i_{s} \vspace*{2mm} \\
%v_{1} & \mathellipsis & v_{s} & 0 & 0 & 0 & G
\end{array} \right)
\end{array}
\end{equation}
Table \ref{tbl:cvars} shows a summary of the quantities used in \eqref{eqn:T}.

It will often be convenient to gather those quantities having a single subscript into vectors, and those with two subscripts into matrices. 
\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cl}\toprule
$f_s^{(i)}$ & final demand on sector $s$ in country $i$\\
$n_s^{(i)}$ & investment of sector $s$ in country $i$\\
$e_s^{(i)}$ & export of sector $s$ in country $i$\\
$z_{s,t}^{\dagger(i)}$ & intermediate demand on domestic sector $s$ by sector $t$ in country $i$\\
$z_{s,t}^{*(i)}$ & intermediate demand on import sector $s$ by sector $t$ in country $i$\\\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Quantities from data that define a country's economy}\label{tbl:cvars}
\end{table}

We can then characterise a country's economy through the $s$-vectors $\boldsymbol{f}^{(i)}$, $\boldsymbol{n}^{(i)}$ and $\boldsymbol{e}^{(i)}$, and by the $s\times s$ matrices $\boldsymbol{Z}^{\dagger(i)}$ and $\boldsymbol{Z}^{*(i)}$.
In matrix form, $\boldsymbol{T}$ may be written:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:Tvectorised}
\begin{array}{rcc}
\boldsymbol{T} & = & 
\left(
	\begin{array}{ccccccc}
 & \boldsymbol{Z}^{\dag} & & \boldsymbol{f}^\dag & \boldsymbol{n}^\dag & \boldsymbol{e} & \boldsymbol{x} \\
 & \boldsymbol{Z}^* & & \boldsymbol{f}^* & \boldsymbol{n}^* & \boldsymbol{0} & \boldsymbol{i} \\
	\end{array} 
\right)
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\subsection{A Single Country Model}\label{sec:countries}
In the standard input-output model, each country is described by the input-output table described in section \ref{sec:iots} above.
From the elements of $\boldsymbol{Z}^\dagger$ and $\boldsymbol{Z}^*$, each sector has a complete `recipe' for making its output, in terms of the quantities of each good used as input, both domestic and imported. For the remainder of this section, the country superscript will be excluded whenever its presence is clear from the context.

\subsubsection*{Technical Coefficients}\label{sec:techcoeffs}
By dividing intermediate flows by total output, we can arrive at a set of \textit{technical coefficients} which define the input of one sector required per unit output of another.
The amount of good $r$ required by sector $s$ to produce a single unit of output is thus:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:adagger}
a_{r,s}^\dagger = \frac{z^\dagger_{r,s}}{x_s}
\end{equation}
for domestically produced $r$, and
\begin{equation}\label{eq:astar}
a_{r,s}^* = \frac{z^*_{r,s}}{x_s}
\end{equation}
for imported $r$. There are therefore $2s \times s$ technical coefficients for each country\footnote{Recall that single year is assumed throughout this treatment.
In time series analyses there will be $2s \times s$ technical coefficients for every country in every year.}.
These technical coefficients then allow the intermediate requirements (both domestic and imported) to be calculated for any given vector of final, investment and export demands. For sector $s$:
$$
x_s = \sum_r{a^\dagger_{s,r}x_r} + f^\dagger_s + n^\dagger_s + e^\dagger_s 
$$
or, in matrix representation:
\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{x}& = 
\boldsymbol{A^\dagger}\boldsymbol{x}
+ 
\boldsymbol{f^\dagger} + \boldsymbol{n^\dagger} + \boldsymbol{e} 
\label{eqn:xIRIO}
\end{align}
Having calculated total domestic production, we can then calculate the import required to satisfy intermediate and final demands as:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:mIRIO}
\boldsymbol{m}
=
\boldsymbol{A^*}\boldsymbol{x}
+
\boldsymbol{f^*} + \boldsymbol{n^*} 
\end{equation}
Thus the domestic total production and the imports may be completely determined from the total demand and the technical coefficients.

\subsubsection*{Import Ratios}\label{sec:importratios}

Since much of the data on national economies involves a high degree of uncertainty, particularly in the case of those countries not included in the WIOD, we desire that the global model be as simple as possible in terms of its systems and as parsimonious as possible in terms of its parameters, while still including sufficient detail as to provide a useful and informative model of the transfer of goods and value both within and between countries.
The addition of unnecessary layers of complexity would likely increase both the risk and the scale of any errors associated with this uncertainty.
For these reasons, the model features two simplifications inspired by the description of Leontief's global model given by \textcite{duchin_international_2004}.

Leontief assumed that engineers in an importing country do not care where a product originated; they will simply know that domestic production does not meet their demand, and instead demand a perfectly-substitutable imported good.
In a similar spirit, when a product in the present model arrives at the shores of an importing country, it enters a theoretical `national warehouse' along with domestically produced goods, at which point the two become indistinguishable\footnote{Note that this concept is referred to in \textcite{miller_input-output_1985} as \textit{import similarity}}.
The only thing specified by the model is the fraction of all goods used domestically which are supplied by imports. This fraction is assumed to remain fixed per country and per sector, and is called the \textit{import ratio}. It is calculated directly from the country's NIOT as:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:importratio}
d_s^{(i)} = \frac{m_s^{(i)}}{(x_s^{(i)} - e_s^{(i)} ) + m_s^{(i)}}
\end{equation}
where $x_s^{(i)}$, $e_s^{(i)}$ and $m_s^{(i)}$ are the total production, export and import of sector $s$, calculated via equations \eqref{eqn:x} and \eqref{eqn:m} respectively.
The term $(x_s^{(i)} - e_s^{(i)} )$ represents the goods used domestically.
It includes all intermediate demand, including that required to fulfil export requirements, as well as direct flows to final demand and investment, but excludes direct flows to export.
This is because imports may not directly supply export demand as per equation \eqref{eqn:Tvectorised}.

The assumption of fixed import ratios significantly simplifies the model, halving the number of technical coefficients that must be specified for a given country, therefore achieving our goal of model parsimony and making the model easier to interpret and comprehend.
A complete set of inter-sector flows, $\boldsymbol{Z}^{\dagger}$ and $\boldsymbol{Z}^{*}$, relating to both domestically produced and imported goods, may be determined from a single set of combined technical coefficients, $\boldsymbol{A}$ (equal to $\boldsymbol{A}^{\dagger} + \boldsymbol{A}^{*}$), along with an $s$-vector, $\boldsymbol{d}$, of import ratios.
Additionally, as mentioned above, this also represents a more plausible assumption of how sectors split their purchasing between domestic and imported.

Following equation \eqref{eq:adagger}, and letting $\boldsymbol{f} = \boldsymbol{f}^{\dagger} + \boldsymbol{f}^{*}$ and $\boldsymbol{n} = \boldsymbol{n}^{\dagger} + \boldsymbol{n}^{*}$ represent combined final demand and investments respectively, the technical coefficients can then be calculated as:
\begin{equation}
a_{r,s} = \frac{z_{r,s}}{x_s}
\end{equation}
allowing the calculation of $\boldsymbol{x}$ as per equation \eqref{eqn:xIRIO}:
\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{x} 
= 
(\boldsymbol{I} - \boldsymbol{\hat{d}})
(
\boldsymbol{Ax} + 
\boldsymbol{f} + \boldsymbol{n}
)
+ \boldsymbol{e}
\label{eqn:xmodel}
\end{align}
and hence of $\boldsymbol{m}$ from equation \eqref{eqn:importratio}:
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{m} = 
(\boldsymbol{I} - 
\boldsymbol{\hat{d}})^{-1} 
\boldsymbol{\hat{d}}\boldsymbol{x}\label{eqn:mmodel}
\end{equation}
where $\boldsymbol{\hat{d}}$ is an $s \times s$ matrix whose diagonal elements are the import ratios, $d_s$, and $\boldsymbol{I}$ is an appropriate identity matrix.
Having calculated the total production, $\boldsymbol{x}$, in equation \eqref{eqn:xmodel}, and letting $\boldsymbol{Z}$ represent the combined inter-sector flows $\boldsymbol{Z}^{\dagger} + \boldsymbol{Z}^{*}$, every individual inter-sector flow can be recovered as follows:
\begin{align}
\boldsymbol{Z}& = \boldsymbol{A}\boldsymbol{\hat{x}}\nonumber\\
\boldsymbol{Z^*}& = \boldsymbol{\hat{d}}\boldsymbol{Z}\\
\boldsymbol{Z^\dagger}& = (\boldsymbol{I} - \boldsymbol{\hat{d}})
	\boldsymbol{Z}\label{eqn:zstar}
\end{align}
Additional benefits of the import ratios assumption include the fact that final demand and investment have only $s$ elements to be specified, rather than the $2s$ elements shown in equation \eqref{eqn:T}.
This implies that consumers have no preference between domestic and imported goods.
Rather it is up to the sectors to decide how best to meet the single demand for their product.

\subsection{An International Trade Model}\label{sec:trade}
In standard inter-regional input-output modelling (IRIO), each sector in each country is explicit about which countries it gets its imports from. 
This requires each sector to have $s \times c$ technical coefficients, an onerous data requirement and, as already mentioned, a strain on the credulousness of the assumptions. 

The WIOD present all these technical coefficients in the world input-output tables (WIOTs) which they publish, but the present model instead makes a second assumption, related to what Leontief via \textcite{duchin_international_2004} refers to as ``export shares''.

\subsubsection*{Import Propensities}
The model assumes that a country gets each product from its international trading partners in fixed proportions.
Thus, country $j$ will always import the same proportion of total demand for product $s$ from country $i$.
We refer to these fixed proportions as \textit{import propensities} as they describe a country's propensity to import a given good from each other country.
The propensity for country $j$ to import good $s$ from country $i$ is given by:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:importpropensities}
p^{(i,j)}_s = \frac{y^{(i,j)}_s}{\sum_k{y^{(k,j)}_s}}
\end{equation}
where $y^{(i,j)}_s$ is the trade flow of good $s$ from country $i$ to country $j$. The $y_s$ are taken directly from the UN COMTRADE database, with a mapping between the UN's 6-figure product code and the NIOT sector aggregation\footnote{This mapping was provided to us by the team behind the WIOD. This was of invaluable help in creating the present model.}.

Given the import requirements of each country from equation \eqref{eqn:mmodel} and the import propensities from \eqref{eqn:importpropensities}, the export demand on sector $s$ in country $i$ due to demand from country $j$ can be calculated as:
\begin{equation*}
e_s^{(i,j)} = p_s^{(i,j)}m_s^{(j)}
\end{equation*}
and total export demand in country $i$ is therefore:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:emodel}
e_s^{(i)} = \sum_k{p_s^{(i,k)}m_s^{(k)}}
\end{equation}
\noindent Equations \eqref{eqn:importratio}--\eqref{eqn:emodel} thus describe a system which defines the total productions, $x_s^{(i)}$, of all sectors in all countries; the intermediate input-output flows, $z_{s,t}^{\dagger(i)}$ and $z_{s,t}^{*(i)}$; imports, $m_s^{(i)}$; exports, $e_s^{(i)}$; and all trade flows, $y_s^{(i,j)}$, given a set of technical coefficients, $a_{r,s}^{(i)}$, import ratios, $d_s^{(i)}$, trade propensities, $p_s^{(i,j)}$, and final demands\footnote{In the present version of the model, investments, $n_s^{(i)}$, are set to zero. 
Data on investments is provided by the WIOD but it is not used in this version.}, $f_s^{(i)}$. For an exogenous change in any of the latter four parameters, all of the former six categories of flows can be found.

\subsection{Modelling the `rest of the world'}\label{sec:RoW}

\section{Using the model}\label{sec:algorithm}

\subsection{Setting model parameters from data}
As outlined in section \ref{sec:system} above, the model takes four groups of parameters and produces a complete set of flows within countries (input-output flows) and a complete set of trade flows (imports and exports) between countries.
To recap, the four groups of parameters are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Final demand, $f_s^{(i)}$: the quantity of a good consumed by the public and the government of a particular country.
\item Import propensities, $p_s^{(i,j)}$: the proportion of country $j$'s total of import of good $s$ which comes from country $i$.
\item Import ratios, $d_s^{(i)}$: the proportion of country $i$'s total demand for good $s$ which is supplied by imports.
\item Technical coefficients, $a_{r,s}^{(i)}$: the quantity of good $r$ required in country $i$ to make a single unit of good $s$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Solving the model algorithmically}\label{sec:algorithm_subsec}

Figure \ref{fig:algorithm} shows a schematic version of the algorithm for calculating imports and exports from the four groups of parameters.
Initially all export demands are set to 0.
Inside each country, total demand is calculated using the technical coefficients and import ratios, as per equation \eqref{eqn:xmodel}.
From this, import demand can be calculated via the import ratios as in equation \eqref{eqn:mmodel}.
Turning to the international trade model, these import demands can be turned into export demands using the import propensities according to equation \eqref{eqn:emodel}.
At this point, each country model has a been given new set of export demands leading, again via the technical coefficients and the import ratios, to a new set of import demands.

An iteration condition is then checked: do exports and imports balance globally to within some small $\epsilon>0$?
If they do balance, the iteration is complete. If not, we continue to iterate between the country-level and the international-level models until the system of imports and exports converges.

\section{Analysis}\label{sec:analysis}
The model combining input-output country descriptions and the international trade network allows for the measurement of the total input required to make a single unit of a particular sector's good.
Since the WIOD reports goods flows in millions of US dollars (\$M), this will also be the unit of all the following analysis.

A simple way to measure the efficiency of a sector is to model the reduction of final demand for the goods of that sector by one unit, and measure the response of each other sector in the model. We can formalise the final-demand change in sector $s$ in country $i$ as:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:reduce_fd_by_one}
f_s^{(i)} \rightarrow f_s^{\prime (i)} \equiv (f_s^{(i)} - 1)
\end{equation}

The simplest way to define `response' is as the change of total output of all sectors, $r$, in all countries, $j$, caused by the reduction:
\begin{equation}
\Delta_{s}^{(i)} x_{r}^{(j)} \equiv (x_{r}^{\prime(j)} - x_r^{(j)})
\end{equation}
where $x_{r}^{\prime(j)}$ is the total output of sector $r$ in country $j$ after the change in equation \eqref{eqn:reduce_fd_by_one} has taken place and the model has been recalculated according to Figure \ref{fig:algorithm}.
$\Delta_{s}^{(i)} x_{r}^{(j)}$ is thus the change in output of sector $r$ in country $j$ induced by the change in final demand for sector $s$ in country $i$.

The total response across all countries and all sectors induced by sector $s$ in country $i$ is:
\begin{equation}
\eta_s^{(i)} \equiv \Delta x_{s}^{(i)} = \sum_j \sum_r \Delta_{s}^{(i)} x_{r}^{(j)}
\end{equation}
and the average response induced by all sectors in country $i$ is:
\begin{equation}
\eta^{(i)} = \frac{\sum_s \eta_s^{(i)}}{s}
\end{equation}
where $s$ is, as before, the number of sectors in country $i$'s economy.

Sectors with a larger value of $\eta_s^{(i)}$ require a larger amount of input to produce each unit of their output. $\eta{(i)}$ can thus be thought of as an (in)efficiency measure, with larger values implying a less-efficient production technology on average across all sectors in a given country.

Figure \ref{tbl:least_efficient_countries} shows the 10 least efficient countries by this measure.
China is the world's least efficient producer, a \$1M reduction in final demand leading to an average \$2.36M reduction in total output worldwide.

This is perhaps a surprising result.
How can one of the world's acknowledged economic powerhouses have inefficient production technologies?
To investigate further, it is useful to split the efficiency measure, $\eta^{(i)}$, into foreign and domestic effects, as follows:

\begin{align}
\eta_s^{*(i)} \equiv \Delta x_{s}^{*(i)} & = 
	\sum_{j \neq i} \sum_r \Delta_{s}^{(i)} x_{r}^{(j)} \\
\eta^{*(i)} & = 
	\frac{\sum_s \eta_s^{*(i)}}{s}
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
\eta_s^{\dagger(i)} \equiv \Delta x_{s}^{\dagger(i)} & = 
	\sum_r \Delta x_{sr}^{(ii)} \\
\eta^{\dagger(i)} & = 
	\frac{\sum_s \eta_s^{\dagger(i)}}{s}
\end{align}
such that
\begin{equation}
\eta^{(i)} = \eta^{*(i)} + \eta^{\dagger(i)}
\end{equation}
Figure \ref{fig:countries_domestic_vs_foreign} shows how the average response across all sectors divides between domestic response, $\eta_s^{\dagger}$, and foreign response, $\eta_s^{*}$, for each country. 
An OLS regression line has been added to the plot.
Countries which lie close to the line all have a similar total efficiency, $\eta^{(i)}$.
The region below the line is the region of greater-than-average efficiency and that above the line is the region of less-than-average efficiency.
China is immediately visible as an outlier.
Its production technology is around one-third less efficient ($\eta = 2.36$) than that of Brazil ($\eta = 1.75$) or India ($\eta = 1.74$), but almost all of this extra inefficiency in targeted at domestic sectors.
Thus China's production inefficiencies benefit its domestic sectors to a disproportionate extent.

\caption{The total response of the global economy to a reduction in final demand, averaged across every sector in a country. 
`Response' is defined as the total production lost across all sectors.
Here, response has been divided into domestic, where the response is measured only in the country whose final demand has been reduced, and foreign, where the response is measured in all other countries only.
The solid line shows the result of an OLS regression, with the grey shaded area being the 5\% confidence interval.}

\end{figure}


Countries further to the left of Figure \ref{fig:countries_domestic_vs_foreign}, such as Brazil, India, Japan, Russia, Turkey and the USA, are more self-reliant than those on the right, such as Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark.
This self-reliance can be made precise by measuring the ratio of domestic response to foreign response:
\begin{equation}
\phi^{(i)} = \frac{\eta^{*(i)}}{\eta^{\dagger(i)}}
\end{equation}
Figure \ref{fig:phi-vs-pop} shows the relationship between $\phi^{(i)}$ and population in 2010 (World Development Indicators, The World Bank).

The positive slope of the regression line (significant at 0.1\%) indicates that larger countries are generally more self-reliant.
Brazil and Australia are both more self-reliant than their population would suggest.
This might be an outcome of limiting the data set to 40 countries: none of Brazil's neighbours is in the data set, and only Indonesia could be regarded as in any way neighbouring Australia.

\subsection*{A unified network approach}
The flow of goods between countries can be viewed as a weighted, directed network, where countries are nodes, and the weights of each edge represents the magnitude of the flow between them \parencite{nystuen_graph_1961,serrano_topology_2003,bhattacharya_international_2008,baskaran_heckscher-ohlin_2011}.
Similarly with the sector-sector flows which constitute an input-output model \parencite{blochl_vertex_2011}.
Network science has developed useful ways to analyse the sort of weighted, directed networks which the constitute the present model, but a single network representation is required which combines the international and the sub-national networks.

Recall from section \ref{sec:importratios} above, that goods arriving at the shores of an importing country are put into a warehouse along with domestically produced goods, at which point the two become indistinguishable.
If an additional assumption is made that domestic sectors take from this warehouse by method of a random sample, then the fraction of goods in each sample from abroad will be identical, as will the fraction of imported goods from each exporter.
These fractions will be set by the import ratios and import propensities respectively.

This additional assumption allows us to specify a complete system of intermediate (input-output) flows, $y_{rs}^{(i,j)}$, from sector $r$ in country $i$ to sector $s$ in country $j$:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:y_rsij}
y_{rs}^{(i,j)} = p_{r}^{(i,j)} d_{r}^{(j)} a_{rs}^{(j)} x_{s}^{(j)}
\end{equation}
Equation \eqref{eqn:y_rsij} can be understood as follows:
sector $s$ in country $j$ requires an amount $a_{rs}^{(j)} x_{s}^{(j)}$ of sector $r$'s good to produce its total output;
a fraction $d_{r}^{(j)}$ of this will be supplied by imports;
a fraction $p_{r}^{(i,j)}$ of these imports will come from country $i$. Note that since countries do not import their own exports, $p_s^{(i,i)}=0,\ \forall i$, and the expression holds trivially for $i=j$.

The fractions of each type of demand for $s$ in country $j$ which was exported by country $i$ are given by similar expressions:

\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:y_rsij}
f_{s}^{(i,j)} = p_{s}^{(i,j)} d_{s}^{(j)} f_{s}^{(j)}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:y_rsij}
e_{s}^{(i,j)} = p_{s}^{(i,j)} d_{s}^{(j)} e_{s}^{(j)}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:y_rsij}
n_{s}^{(i,j)} = p_{s}^{(i,j)} d_{s}^{(j)} n_{s}^{(j)}
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
where, as previously, $f$ is final demand, $e$ is export demand and $n$ are investments.

Along with the sector-to-sector flows given by equation \eqref{eqn:zstar}, this allows the representation of all the flows in the present model as a single network, and standard network analysis techniques can then be used.

We can visualise the changes which occur following the reduction of demand in China for the Vehicles sector by \$1M.
The change to every flow (both $y_{rs}^{(i,j)}$ and $z_{rs}^{(i)}$ type flows) in the eight most-affected countries is recorded and visualised in figure \ref{fig:chnvehtop6}.
Node size is proportional to eigenvector centrality and the edge weight is proportional to the change induced in the particular flow be the reduction in final demand.
This diagram reveals the patterns and shapes of the various economies which would be hard to pick out in the raw flow matrix.
