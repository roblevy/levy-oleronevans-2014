\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
A global model is presented that can be used as the basis for assessing the impacts of future changes in trade, migration, security and development aid.
The model is based on input-output models for 40 countries, linked with trade data at the sector level.
This is made possible by the World Input-Output Database, a collection of input-output tables for 40 countries across 15 years, and by databases of commodities and services trade from the UN.
The model is constructed using a minimum number of assumptions, and is based as far as possible on empirical observation.
Some initial analysis of the model and its properties are also presented
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
The objective of this paper is to present global economic model that can be used as the basis for assessing the impacts of future changes in trade, migration, security and development aid.
The model presented here represents a first `proof of concept' step towards this ambitious goal.
The economies of individual countries are represented as 35-sector input-output models each of which is linked through trade flows representing imports and exports.
This has recently been made feasible by the publication of the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) \parencite{Timmer2012}, a collection of input-output tables (IOTs) for 40 countries across 15 years, from 1995 to 2009.
The IOTs are linked through data from the UN covering trade in both goods\footnote{comtrade.un.org/db} and services\footnote{unstats.un.org/unsd/servicetrade/}.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: 
Section \ref{sec:litreview} gives an overview of existing work in this area.
Section \ref{sec:system} gives a description of the present system and outlines how data is used to calibrate the parameters of the model.
The algorithm used to calculate the output of the model is described in section \ref{sec:algorithm} and some preliminary results are given in section \ref{sec:results}.

Some concluding comments are added in section \ref{sec:conclusions}.

\section{Existing Global Economic Models} \label{sec:litreview}
In the mid-1970s, the creator of input-output economics, Wassily Leontief, had just won the Nobel prize for Economics and took the prestige that this bestowed on him as an opportunity to announce a very ambitious project to model the global economy:

\begin{quotation}
Major efforts are underway to construct a data base for a systematic input-output study not of a single national economy but of the world economy viewed as a system composed of many interrelated parts [...]
Preliminary plans provide for a description of the world economy in terms of twenty-eight groups of countries, with about forty-five productive sectors for each group. \attrib{\cite{Leontief1974}}
\end{quotation}

Some 20 years later, Faye Duchin, a former research assistant of Leontief, describes how Leontief's efforts in this area have largely been ignored by economists, describing the departures from the standard, neoclassical modelling in terms of price elasticity and elasticity of substitution as being ``too great to ignore'' \parencite{Duchin2004}. 
See section \ref{sec:iots} for more on this subject.

In the years since Leontief published his global model, Input-output analysis has been largely restricted to regional studies, of which \textcite{Akita1993}, \textcite{Khan1999} and \textcite{Luo2013a} are examples; and studies related to energy and the environment, such as  \textcite{Leontief1970}, \textcite{Joshi1999}, \textcite{Bergh2002} and \textcite{Hendrickson2006}.

However, much more recently, attention has returned to input-output modelling in a global context more generally. \textcite{Tukker2013} describe how several multi-regional input-output (MRIO) models have been developed in the very recent literature.
These are, along with the WIOD which is used in the present model, EORA \parencite{Lenzen2012}, EXIOPOL \parencite{Tukker2013a} and the slightly more mature, and proprietorial GTAP \parencite{Walmsley2012}.

\section{The System Description} \label{sec:system}
\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cl}
$f_s^{(i)}$ & final demand on sector $s$ in country $i$\\
$n_s^{(i)}$ & investment of sector $s$ in country $i$\\
$e_s^{(i)}$ & export of sector $s$ in country $i$\\
$z_{s,t}^{\dagger(i)}$ & intermediate demand on domestic sector $s$ by sector $t$ in country $i$\\
$z_{s,t}^{*(i)}$ & intermediate demand on import sector $s$ by sector $t$ in country $i$
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Quantities from data which define a country's economy}\label{tbl:cvars}
\end{table}

The present model has $c$ countries, the economies of which are divided into $s$ productive sectors.
We assume that each sector produces a single good, thus `sector' and `product' are used interchangeably. 
Goods produced domestically are labelled with a dagger superscript ($\dagger$) and imported goods with an asterisk superscript.
Table \ref{tbl:cvars} shows the quantities, taken from data, which characterise a country's economy for a particular year.
Note that for clarity, no time subscript is added. In future time-series analyses such a subscript would have to be added.

\subsection{Input-Output Tables} \label{sec:iots}
Input-output is, at its heart, an accounting methodology. By simple summation total production of sector $s$ in country $i$ can be defined as the sum of all intermediate supply, plus supply to final demand, investment and export:
$$
x_s^{(i)}=\sum\limits_{t}z_{s,t}^{\dagger(i)} + f_s^{\dagger} + n_s^{\dagger} + e_s
$$
and the total import of sector $s$ in country $i$ as the sum of all intermediate supply by imported goods, plus demand for and investment of imported goods:
$$
m_s^{(i)}=\sum\limits_{t}z_{s,t}^{*(i)} + f_s^* + n_s^*
$$
By assembling the data values describing a country in a particular arrangement, an input-output table can be constructed, $\boldsymbol{T}^{(i)}$, as described by \textcite{Miller1985}.
Neglecting the $(i)$ superscript for clarity, the input-output table is defined as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{rcc}
\boldsymbol{T} & = & \begin{array}{rc}
\begin{array}{cc} \hspace*{17mm} & \mbox{Sector} \end{array} & \begin{array}{ccccccc} 1 & \mathellipsis & s & \mbox{F.D.} & \mbox{Inv} & \mbox{Exp} & \mbox{Tot} \end{array} \vspace*{2mm} \\
\begin{array}{r}
\begin{array}{rc}
\mbox{Domestic} & \left\{ \begin{array}{c}
1 \\
\vdots \\
s
\end{array} \right. \\
\mbox{Imports} & \left\{ \begin{array}{c}
1 \\
\vdots \\
s \\
\end{array} \right.
\end{array} \vspace*{2mm} \\
%\begin{array}{cc} \hspace*{17mm} & \mbox{Value Added} \end{array}
\end{array} &
\left( \begin{array}{ccccccc}
z^{\dag}_{1,1} & \mathellipsis & z^{\dag}_{1,s} & f^\dag_{1} & n^\dag_{1} & e^\dag_{1} & x_1 \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
z^{\dag}_{s,1} & \mathellipsis & z^{\dag}_{s,s} & f^\dag_{s} & n^\dag_{s} & e^\dag_{s} & x_{s} \\
z^*_{1,1} & \mathellipsis & z^*_{1,s} & f^*_{1} & n^*_{1} & 0 & i_1 \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
z^*_{s,1} & \mathellipsis & z^*_{s,s} & f^*_{s} & n^*_{s} & 0 & i_{s} \vspace*{2mm} \\
%v_{1} & \mathellipsis & v_{s} & 0 & 0 & 0 & G
\end{array} \right)
\end{array}
\end{array}
$$

\noindent It will often be convenient to gather the quantities in table \ref{tbl:cvars} with a single subscript into vectors, and those with two subscripts into matrices. 
We can then characterise a country's economy through the $s$-vectors $\boldsymbol{f}^{(i)}$, $\boldsymbol{n}^{(i)}$ and $\boldsymbol{e}^{(i)}$, and by the $s\times s$ matrices $\boldsymbol{Z}^{\dagger(i)}$ and $\boldsymbol{Z}^{*(i)}$.
In matrix form, $\boldsymbol{T}$ may be written:

$$
\begin{array}{rcc}
\boldsymbol{T} & = & 
\left(
	\begin{array}{ccccccc}
 & \boldsymbol{Z}^{\dag} & & \boldsymbol{f}^\dag & \boldsymbol{n}^\dag & \boldsymbol{e} & \boldsymbol{x} \\
 & \boldsymbol{Z}^* & & \boldsymbol{f}^* & \boldsymbol{n}^* & \boldsymbol{0} & \boldsymbol{i} \\
	\end{array} 
\right)
\end{array}
$$
