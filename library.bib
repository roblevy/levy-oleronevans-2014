	abstract = {The {BRIC} economies are expected to further increase their share and importance in the world economy. Whereas their growth strategies and their integration in the world production system has been widely analyzed from different angles, it seems that there has been less attention paid to how integration in the global economy (and openness) is related to integration in the regional economy. Firstly, we will therefore propose a series of indicators to better assess the interdependence between the {BRIC} economies and the economies of their respective {\textquoteleft}regions{\textquoteright}, be it institutionalized or de facto regions. Secondly, we will present a series of statistical tests to evaluate the relationship between globalization and regionalization. This should further clarify the implications of a scenario of sustained growth and globalization in the {BRICs} for the patterns and levels of production and trade in their regions of influence. Among the findings of this article, model estimations suggest that the relative globalization of the {BRICs} is related to more global sourcing by the {BRICs}, enhanced regional competitiveness of the {BRICs}, and more asymmetry and trade dependence from the perspective of the regional trade partners.},

	abstract = {What kinds of evidence reliably support predictions of effectiveness for health and social care interventions? There is increasing reliance, not only for health care policy and practice but also for more general social and economic policy deliberation, on evidence that comes from studies whose basic logic is that of {JS} Mill's method of difference. These include randomized controlled trials, case{\textendash}control studies, cohort studies, and some uses of causal Bayes nets and counterfactual-licensing models like ones commonly developed in econometrics. The topic of this paper is the {\textquoteleft}external validity{\textquoteright} of causal conclusions from these kinds of studies. We shall argue two claims. Claim, negative: external validity is the wrong idea; claim, positive: {\textquoteleft}capacities{\textquoteright} are almost always the right idea, if there is a right idea to be had. If we are right about these claims, it makes big problems for policy decisions. Many advice guides for grading policy predictions give top grades to a proposed policy if it has two good Mill's-method-of difference studies that support it. But if capacities are to serve as the conduit for support from a method-of-difference study to an effectiveness prediction, much more evidence, and much different in kind, is required. We will illustrate the complexities involved with the case of multisystemic therapy, an internationally adopted intervention to try to diminish antisocial behaviour in young people.},

Here we extend the {CC} to the case of (binary and weighted) directed networks and we compute its expected value for random graphs. We distinguish between {CCs} that count all directed triangles in the graph (independently of the direction of their edges) and {CCs} that only consider particular types of directed triangles (e.g., cycles).

	abstract = {We introduce a technique to filter out complex data sets by extracting a subgraph of representative links. Such a filtering can be tuned up to any desired level by controlling the genus of the resulting graph. We show that this technique is especially suitable for correlation-based graphs, giving filtered graphs that preserve the hierarchical organization of the minimum spanning tree but containing a larger amount of information in their internal structure. In particular in the case of planar filtered graphs (genus equal to 0), triangular loops and four-element cliques are formed. The application of this filtering procedure to 100 stocks in the U.S. equity markets shows that such loops and cliques have important and significant relationships with the market structure and properties.},

Inspection of the country databases of exported products shows that this is not the case: successful countries are extremely diversified, in analogy with biosystems evolving in a competitive dynamical environment. The challenge is assessing quantitatively the non-monetary competitive advantage of diversification which represents the hidden potential for development and growth. Here we develop a new statistical approach based on coupled non-linear maps, whose fixed point defines a new metrics for the country Fitness and product Complexity. We show that a non-linear iteration is necessary to bound the complexity of products by the fitness of the less competitive countries exporting them. We show that, given the paradigm of economic complexity, the correct and simplest approach to measure the competitiveness of countries is the one presented in this work. Furthermore our metrics appears to be economically well-grounded.},

This is because specialization and trade introduce de facto diminishing returns: countries that accumulate capital faster than average experience declining export prices, depressing the rate of return to capital and discouraging further accumulation. Because of constant returns to capital accumulation from a global perspective, the world growth rate is determined by policies, savings, and technologies, as in endogenous growth models. Because of diminishing returns to capital accumulation at the country level, the cross-sectional behavior of the world economy is similar to that of existing exogenous growth models: cross-country variation in economic policies, savings, and technology translate into crosscountry variation in incomes. The dispersion of the world income distribution is determined by the forces that shape the strength of the terms-of-trade effects{\textemdash} the degree of openness to international trade and the extent of specialization.},

One approach, the complexity profile, is a measure of the information to describe a system as a function of the scale at which it is observed. We present a new formulation of the complexity profile, which expands its possible application to high-dimensional real-world and mathematically defined systems. The new method is constructed from the pairwise dependencies between components of the system. The pairwise approach may serve as both a formulation in its own right and a computationally feasible approximation to the original complexity profile. We compare it to the original complexity profile by giving cases where they are equivalent, proving properties common to both methods, and demonstrating where they differ. Both formulations satisfy linear superposition for unrelated systems and conservation of total degrees of freedom (sum rule). The new pairwise formulation is also a monotonically nonincreasing function of scale. Furthermore, we show that the new formulation defines a class of related complexity profile functions for a given system, demonstrating the generality of the formalism.},

Moreover, we have designed the methodology in a manner that overcomes the major shortcomings of the supply-driven approach. We apply the methodology to a 90-day disruption at the twin seaports of Beaumont and Port Arthur, Texas, which is a major port area that includes a petrochemical manufacturing complex. We find that regional gross output could decline by as much as \$13 billion at the port region level, but that resilience can reduce these impacts by nearly 70\%.},

The new model generalizes the World Model of Leontief et al. (1977) in ways that make it particularly useful for analyzing scenarios about sustainable development. Major properties of the model are demonstrated, and sources of the gains from trade are identified for the world as a whole and for individual regions. Illustrative results are reported for a 10-region, 8-good, 3-factor model of the world economy.},

A time series of balanced input{\textendash}output tables for the {UK} was constructed for the period 1992 to 2004 by using a matrix balancing procedure that is able to handle conflicting external data and inconsistent constraints. Detailed sectoral and country-specific trade data for the {UK} were compiled and reconciled with the {UK} input{\textendash}output data, and economic and environmental accounts for three world regions were integrated in a {UK}-specific {MRIO} model. This was subsequently used to calculate a time series of national carbon footprints for the {UK} from 1992 to 2004. Greenhouse gas emissions embedded in {UK} trade are distinguished by destination of imports to intermediate and final demand. Most greenhouse gases show a significant increase over time in consumer emissions and a widening gap between producer and consumer emissions. Net {CO}2 emissions embedded in {UK} imports increased from 4.3\% of producer emissions in 1992 to a maximum of 20\% in 2002. The total estimated {UK} carbon footprint in 2004 was 730 Mt for {CO}2 and 934 Mt {CO}2 equivalents for all greenhouse gases.},

The procedure makes direct use of relationships that emerge from the model of cost minimization subject to producing a desired level of output. Based on an initial specification of constant cross-price derivatives, the imposition of adding up and symmetry conditions allows the actual price and coefficient changes that occur between periods to identify implicit own and cross-price derivatives and corresponding elasticities, using data for only two time periods. With this updated approach, the calculation of derivatives is far simpler and leads to far more accurate measures of price-induced input{\textendash}output coefficient changes than the original version.},

True technical efficiency is procyclical even though production takes place with constant returns, without technology shocks or technological externalities.

A sector's power-of-pull is defined and calculated as a function of the powers-of-pull of those sectors that it pulls through network linkages, and their powers-of-pull are, in turn, functions of those sectors that they further pull ad infinitum throughout the network. Theoretically, boosting activities in sectors with a higher power-of-pull will generate greater network effects while stimulating the entire economy, especially during recessions. This method is applied to the United States in the years before and after the 2008 financial crisis. The results provide a fresh look at the U.S. government's economic revival policies and reveal fundamental changes in the economic structure of the U.S. This work advocates a network-based analysis of the economy as a complex system. {\textcopyright} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Both are based on random walks and have interpretations as the propagation of supply shocks through the economy. Random walk centrality reveals the vertices most immediately affected by a shock. Counting betweenness identifies the nodes where a shock lingers longest. The two measures differ in how they treat self-loops. We apply both to data from a wide set of countries and uncover salient characteristics of the structures of these national economies. We further validate our indices by clustering according to sectors{\textquoteright} centralities. This analysis reveals geographical proximity and similar developmental status.},

In this framework, the growth impact of aid is examined jointly with the determination of rent-seeking behavior. We test the main predictions of the model for a crosssection of 75 aid-recipient countries. There is evidence that aid has a direct positive effect on growth, which is however significantly mitigated by the adverse indirect effects of associated rent-seeking activities. This is especially the case in recipient countries with relatively large public sectors.},

This paper takes a network perspective to rank sectors according to the Power-of-Pull ({PoP}), i.e. a sector's power to pull the overall economy. An eigenvector method is employed to assess the {PoP} of sectors in the {USA}, using input{\textendash}output data from 1998 to 2010. The results support bailout to the motor vehicle sector, but argue against bailout to public infrastructure, health care and information technologies design and service sectors, and also reveal the continual decline of {PoP} ranking of computer and electronics manufacturing sector over time. These results confirm some but also show little support to some other economic revival policies of the Obama Administration in the {USA}.},

	abstract = {Abstract The aid effectiveness literature ({AEL}) consists of empirical macroeconomic estimates of the effects of development aid. By the end of 2004, it comprised 97 econometric studies of three families of related effects. Each family has been analyzed in a separate meta-analysis. The {AEL} is an ideal subject for meta-analysis as it uses only a few formally similar models to estimate the same underlying effects. It is also an area with strong beliefs, often generated by altruism. When this whole literature is examined, a clear pattern emerges. After 40 years of development aid, the preponderance of the evidence indicates that aid has not been effective. We show that the distribution of results is significantly asymmetric reflecting the reluctance of the research community to publish negative results. The Dutch disease effect on exchange rates provides a plausible explanation for the observed aid ineffectiveness.},

Economic Systems Research, 23, 153{\textendash}174], this paper presents an updated approach to the estimation of input coefficient changes as functions of changing prices. The procedure makes direct use of relationships that emerge from the model of cost minimization subject to producing a desired level of output. Based on an initial specification of constant cross-price derivatives, the imposition of adding up and symmetry conditions allows the actual price and coefficient changes that occur between periods to identify implicit own and cross-price derivatives and corresponding elasticities, using data for only two time periods. With this updated approach, the calculation of derivatives is far simpler and leads to far more accurate measures of price-induced input{\textendash}output coefficient changes than the original version.},

For the former, with a little creative and judicious re-packaging, it will yield at least half of the literature review of any thesis; for the latter, it will provide near instant erudition in fields far removed from ones own speciality. . . Because of its encyclopaedic character, it also tells us something about our profession as a whole and how we work. . . a word of appreciation to the editor of this volume. All of the 79 articles were commissioned pieces, written by 92 authors, each reviewed by 2 anonymous reviewers, revised and re-submitted. Any reader who has edited a commissioned volume will appreciate the majesty and miraculous nature of this achievement. Frank Convery, Environment and Resource Economics This is what it says, a handbook, something to be accessed for in-depth information on specific topics: and there can be no doubt that it is a good one . . . I certainly expect to use it as a basic source on numerous key and specialised topics for many years to come, and to refer others to it with confidence. Colin Price, Environment and Planning B This handbook is the essential reference work in the field. Importantly, the material included is ecumenical in two senses. It is inclusive of authors and perspectives from Europe, North American and developing regions. Further, it gives serious attention to environmental macroeconomics and other key topics more commonly found in compendia on ecological economics. The integration of those topics with more traditional areas of environmental and resource economics is a most useful contribution to greater communication within the broader discipline. Coverage is comprehensive and at a level accessible to practitioners, researchers, and students. References at the end of each chapter constitute a bibliography that provides extensive direction to the foundational and emerging literature for each topic. Highly recommended for upper-division undergraduate through professional collections. J.V. Hall, Choice The handbook is the most comprehensive summary of the theory and practice of environmental and resource economics produced to date. It blends the perspectives of experts from Europe, the {US} and developing economies on the field, what has been accomplished, and the research frontier ahead. Anyone who wants a thorough source book for accessing the multi-faceted components of this field should have this volume in his library. V. Kerry Smith, Arizona State University, {US} An impressively comprehensive and informative overview of the field. This book is a must, both as a reference of enduring value and for the authoritative articles it provides. William J. Baumol, New York University and Princeton University, {US} This major reference book comprises specially commissioned surveys in environmental and resource economics written by an international team of experts. Authoritative yet accessible, each entry provides a state-of-the-art summary of key areas that will be invaluable to researchers, practitioners and advanced students. The handbook contains 79 chapters distributed over 10 main sections: introduction economics of natural resources economics of environmental policy international aspects of environmental economics and policy space in environmental economics environmental macroeconomics economic valuation and evaluation interdisciplinary issues methods and models in environmental and resource economics prospects Aside from being the most extensive survey of environmental and resource economics available today, the handbook contains several special and unique features. Five of the ten main sections cover topics that are addressed marginally or not at all in previous handbooks or other surveys. Moreover, in addition to overviews of the standard (neoclassical) approach, the book covers core elements of ecological economics in the section on interdisciplinary issues,},

	abstract = {Most papers that employ Differences-in-Differences estimation ({DD}) use many years of data and focus on serially correlated outcomes but ignore that the resulting standard errors are inconsistent. To illustrate the severity of this issue, we randomly generate placebo laws in state-level data on female wages from the Current Population Survey. For each law, we use {OLS} to compute the {DD} estimate of its {\textquotedblleft}effect{\textquotedblright} as well as the standard error of this estimate. These conventional {DD} standard errors severely understate the standard deviation of the estimators: we find an {\textquotedblleft}effect{\textquotedblright} significant at the 5 percent level for up to 45 percent of the placebo interventions. We use Monte Carlo simulations to investigate how well existing methods help solve this problem. Econometric corrections that place a specific parametric form on the time-series process do not perform well. Bootstrap (taking into account the autocorrelation of the data) works well when the number of states is large enough. Two corrections based on asymptotic approximation of the variance-covariance matrix work well for moderate numbers of states and one correction that collapses the time series information into a {\textquotedblleft}pre{\textquotedblright}- and {\textquotedblleft}post{\textquotedblright}-period and explicitly takes into account the effective sample size works well even for small numbers of states.},

Their framework relies heavily on an assumption of symmetry among countries. For issues related to North-South trade, this assumption is problematic. In this paper, we develop an asymmetric extension of the Anderson{\textendash}{vanWincoop} framework appropriate to the analysis of North-South trade, where Northern countries produce differentiated goods and Southern countries homogenous ones. In addition, we use an appropriately extended version of Baier and Bergtrand and Taylor linear expansion {\textendash} thus permitting its estimation using (good old) {OLS}. The result is an empirical model that (i) is better suited to the analysis of North-South trade, (ii) is easy to estimate and compute comparative statics, not requiring a customised {NLS} routine and, given the way the South is included, (iii) provides a simple explanation of zero trade flows between some country pairs, a fact still not fully explained in the literature. As an illustration of its use, we examine the empirical link between foreign aid and trade.},

We propose a new measure of reciprocity that allows the ordering of networks according to their actual degree of correlation between mutual links. We find that real networks are always either correlated or anticorrelated, and that networks of the same type (economic, social, cellular, financial, ecological, etc.) display similar values of the reciprocity. The observed patterns are not reproduced by current models. This leads us to introduce a more general framework where mutual links occur with a conditional connection probability. In some of the studied networks we discuss the form of the conditional connection probability and the size dependence of the reciprocity.},

The result is a map that both simplifies and highlights the regularities in the structure and their relationships. We illustrate the method by making a map of scientific communication as captured in the citation patterns of {\textgreater}6,000 journals. We discover a multicentric organization with fields that vary dramatically in size and degree of integration into the network of science.

	abstract = {This article concentrates on the Jacobs and Daly criticisms (Environmental Values, Spring 1994) of my earlier article in the same journal (Autumn 1994) criticising the concept of 'sustainable development'. Daly and Jacobs agreed with my criticisms of 'weak' sustainability, but defended 'strong' sustainability on the grounds that natural and manmade capital were 'complements' in the productive process and that economists are wrong, therefore, in assuming that they are infinitely substitutable. This article maintains that they are confusing different concepts of 'complementarity' and 'substitutability'. It is also argued that, in fact, they do both sell crucial passes in their defence of strong sustainability without providing any clear criteria for their abandonment of it in certain cases. It is also denied that the fact that environmental services may provide different satisfactions from those obtained from other goods and services elevates it to the status of some over-riding moral value, or that discounting future costs and benefits is 'unfair' to future generations.},

It is the second part of a two-part contribution. In Part 1 [Turner, K., Lenzen, M., Wiedmann, T. and Barrett, J. in press. Examining the Global Environmental Impact of Regional Consumption Activities {\textemdash} Part 1: A Technical Note on Combining Input{\textendash}Output and Ecological Footprint Analysis; Ecological Economics.] we describe how to enumerate the resource and pollution content of inter-regional and inter-national trade flows with the aim to illustrate an ideal accounting and modelling framework for the estimation of Ecological Footprints.

A large number of such environment-economic models have been described but only in the last few years models have emerged that use a more sophisticated multi-region, multi-sector input{\textendash}output framework. This has been made possible through improvements in data availability and quality as well as computability. We identify six major models that employ multi-sector, multi-region input{\textendash}output analysis in order to calculate environmental impacts embodied in international trade. Results from the reviewed studies demonstrate that it is important to explicitly consider the production recipe, land and energy use as well as emissions in a multi-region, multi-sector and multi-directional trade model with global coverage and detailed sector disaggregation. Only then reliable figures for indicators of impacts embodied in trade, such as the Ecological Footprint, can be derived.},

While foreign aid flows respond to political variables, foreign direct investments are more sensitive to economic incentives, particularly {\textquotedblleft}good policies{\textquotedblright} and protection of property rights in the receiving countries.

On the basis of this assumption it is shown that the model satisfies a contraction property. This open up the possibility of using some quite powerful results from the contraction mapping theory, establishes the existence of solutions, efficient computational procedures, and leads to a rather transparent mathematical theory for the nonlinear input-output model.},

	abstract = {Insights into prehistoric region-wide political consolidation were suggested by simulation results from an agent-based model of pre-state societies. The case study was the late prehistoric period circa 2500 {BC} to {AD} 1000 in the Lake Titicaca basin of Peru and Bolivia. Over a series of simulation runs the model produced a range of alternative political pre-histories. A substantial proportion of those runs were classified as matching the scenario archeologists believe actually happened during this time period. Classification was based on multidimensional quantitative measures of empirical criteria for the emergence of simulated macro-level patterns corresponding to observed patterns in the archaeological record. The model{\textquoteright}s structure consisted of a grid of cells, each scaled to 1.5 km x 1.5 km, representing the geography, hydrology, and agricultural potential of the 50,000 sq. km basin. A collection of multiple agents--Settlements, Peoples, Polities, and Chiefs (political leaders) -- interacted with the environmental grid and with each other. The agents{\textquoteright} behavior was modeled as micro-level condition-action rules based on the hypothesized causal factors of: agriculture, migration, competition, and trade. Internal structure and dynamics as well as the simulation results showed strong indicators of the model{\textquoteright}s structural realism. Uncertainties associated with the model were also assessed.},

	abstract = {The gravity model, long the empirical workhorse for modeling international trade, ignores network dependencies in bilateral trade data, instead assuming that dyadic trade is independent, conditional on a hierarchy of covariates over country, time, and dyad. We argue that there are theoretical as well as empirical reasons to expect network dependencies in international trade. Consequently, standard gravity models are empirically inadequate. We combine a gravity model specification with {\textquotedblleft}latent space{\textquotedblright} networks to develop a dynamic mixture model for real-valued directed graphs. The model simultaneously incorporates network dependencies in both trade incidence and trade volumes. We estimate this model using bilateral trade data from 1990 to 2008. The model substantially outperforms standard accounts in terms of both in- and out-of-sample predictive heuristics. We illustrate the model's usefulness by tracking trading propensities between the {USA} and China.},

Another universal feature is observed in the power-law growth of the trade strength with gross domestic product, the exponent being similar for all countries. Using the 'rich-club' coefficient measure of the weighted networks it has been shown that the size of the rich-club controlling half of the world's trade is actually shrinking. While the gravity law is known to describe well the social interactions in the static networks of population migration, international trade, etc, here for the first time we studied a non-conservative dynamical model based on the gravity law which excellently reproduced many empirical features of the {ITN}.},

Despite these potential limitations, constructing a large {MRIO} requires significant manual labour and many years of time.

	abstract = {The Global Trade Analysis Project ({GTAP}) is a global network of researchers and policy makers conducting quantitative analysis of international policy issues. The motivation and ultimate success of the Project stems from the fact that collaboration is essential for detailed analysis of the global economy. The importance of collaboration to improve the quality of policy analysis world-wide is most clearly seen in the development of the {GTAP} Data Base. The {GTAP} Data Base is the centerpiece of the Global Trade Analysis Project. It records the annual flows of goods and services for the entire world economy in the benchmark year(s). It consists of bilateral trade, transport, and protection matrices that link individual country/regional economic data bases. The production of the {GTAP} Data Base relies on the valuable contributions of many individuals and organizations throughout the world. Individuals contribute the best available input-output table for their country, while other experts contribute the macro, trade, protection and other data required. The Center for Global Trade Analysis, the home of {GTAP}, then brings these contributions together into one useable, globally consistent, database. The result is a fully documented , publicly available and regularly updated global database. This year (2012), the eighth version of the {GTAP} Data Base was released, covering 129 countries, 57 sectors, 5 factors and two base years (2004 and 2007). The {GTAP} Data Base is utilized in a suite of comparative static and dynamic computable general equilibrium models and underlies most contemporary economic analysis of global policy issues related to trade, energy and the environment.},

	abstract = {Critics of foreign aid programs have long argued that poverty reflects government failure. In this paper I test predictions for aid effectiveness based on an analytical framework that relates aid effectiveness to political regimes. I find that aid does not significantly increase investment, nor benefit the poor as measured by improvements in human development indicators, but it does increase the size of government. The impact of aid does not vary according to whether recipient governments are liberal democratic or highly repressive. But liberal political regimes and democracies, ceteris paribus, have on average 30\% lower infant mortality than the least free regimes. This may be due to greater empowerment of the poor under liberal regimes even though the political elite continues to receive the benefits of aid programs. An implication is that short-term aid targeted to support new liberal regimes may be a more successful means of reducing poverty than current programs.},

Firstly, we define a digraph associated with the given economic system (i.e., with its technical coefficients matrix). Secondly, we consider topological properties of this graph to study the economical concepts previously mentioned. Thirdly, we describe different, original algorithms to make the calculations easier. Finally, we give an example from a real economy, Andalusia (a region in Spain).

Along this paper, we also discuss the advantages of this new approach and present some ideas to ease its application in the future research.},

	abstract = {Life-cycle assessment ({LCA}) facilitates a systems view in environmental evaluation of products, materials, and processes. Life-cycle assessment attempts to quantify environmental burdens over the entire life-cycle of a product from raw material extraction, manufacturing, and use to ultimate disposal. However, current methods for {LCA} suffer from problems of subjective boundary definition, inflexibility, high cost, data confidentiality, and aggregation.This paper proposes alternative models to conduct quick, cost effective, and yet comprehensive life-cycle assessments. The core of the analytical model consists of the 498 sector economic input-output tables for the U.S. economy augmented with various sector-level environmental impact vectors. The environmental impacts covered include global warming, acidification, energy use, non-renewable ores consumption, eutrophication, conventional pollutant emissions and toxic releases to the environment. Alternative models are proposed for environmental assessment of individual products, processes, and life-cycle stages by selective disaggregation of aggregate input-output data or by creation of hypothetical new commodity sectors. To demonstrate the method, a case study comparing the life-cycle environmental performance of steel and plastic automobile fuel tank systems is presented.},
